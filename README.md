The idea came up during the course Analysis and Modelling of Systems which focused on using UML diagram to express real-life scenarios of use cases and work in an interation-based development. During the course we achieved a total of 3 iterations and went through three different product development phases. The final product of these 3 iterations is in the folder "Project - Iterations".

Reusing the idea, during the course of Databases, I developed a rather simple database with MySQL which was then tested with a simple GUI built with Visual Studio and Visual Basic. The database is located in the folder "Database". The database has some Stored Procedures, Triggers and Indexes.
